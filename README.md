# Function_fitting

## About the code

This is a code to calculate the parameters of a function to best fit a set of data points, using gradient descent to find the minimum of an Error function.

## Aplications

The original motivation for the code is to fit a sum of gaussians into an x-ray diffraction pattern for a certain amorphous substance.
